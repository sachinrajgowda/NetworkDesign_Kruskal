# NetworkDesign_Kruskal - Python
• Designed and implemented a small network design application which will run a design algorithm (Kruskal’s Algorithm) to create a network on a set of nodes and to determine the network utilization, average path length and average delay. 

• For a given node location list, MST on the nodes are calculated by using Disjoint set method. Network load on each link is then calculated and average delay and average hop count is calculated to analyze the network design.
